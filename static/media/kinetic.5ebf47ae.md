## Supply Chain Intern

![Kinetic Image](images/kinetic-1.png)

I am a member of the **fulfillment team** at the company and aid in the supply chain operations as well. Our main product is a device that is largely used by industrial workers to provide haptic feedback on postures as well as collect data to aid in COVID-19 contact tracing methods. What interests me most about working here is the exposure to working with a team in a manufacturing environment with an emphasis on customer response. We generally communicate with vendors to receive devices and technology we outsourced, then perform quality assurance tests on them, and finally ship them to our clients with the necessary accessories.

I am also tasked with assembling and testing various products in house and providing detailed documentation and assembly instructions. Examples of said products are shown below:
