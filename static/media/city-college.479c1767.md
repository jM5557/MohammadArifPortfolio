### BAJA SAE: CCNY Racing 
#### Steering Team lead

I had led a team in CCNY Racing, also known as the City College of New York Baja SAE team, where we designed and manufactured an all-wheel drive all-terrain vehicle and competed in an intercollegiate competition. As the former lead of the steering team and given that we were preparing to make an all-wheel drive all-terrain vehicle, there was a needed emphasis placed on collaborative teamwork, careful decision making, and a well-developed design assembly. We worked with many structural and linkage components that require extensive FEM and simulation studies in order to ensure structural integrity of the vehicle and first and foremost, driver safety.

### ASHRAE City College Chapter
#### Vice President

My role as the Vice-President of the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) branch in my college is to ensure that students are educated and well informed about the opportunities and achievements that the HVAC industry and young engineers of the organization have to offer and guide them.

Our team had participated in the 2020 HVAC System Selection Competition where we were tasked with comparing and analyzing the uses of three distinct HVAC systems for an archive building in Mumbai, India: conventional Rooftop units (RTUs), solar absorption chiller system, and a geothermal heat pump system. A life cycle cost analysis was performed and presented to compare important factors in HVAC building design such as maintenance/utility costs, electricity usage, general efficiency, environmental impact, etc. Our team had been awarded the Rising Star Award!

### Desktop Injection Molder 

Our group and I were interested in the injection molders used widely in the industry and therefore, drafted to design and manufacture a desktop injection molder as a project. We designed the molder in CAD as an assembly for an initial concept and drafting. We manufactured and machined the injection molder with the use of GD&T guidelines and troubleshooted problems concerning fittings/bearings. Examples of the final project and molds produced are shown below:

### FEM Study on Eyeglass Design

Our team was concerned with the breakage of a team memberâ€™s pair of glasses and decided to perform FEA on eyeglasses design and provide any design suggestions. The project involved making the solid model, pre-processing the model for FEA, sensitivity studies, and implications for design improvements. This project was a very cooperative and intensive experience and we learned much about design and FEA from our efforts.

### FEM Analysis of a Steel Pulley-and-Shaft Design

I was given a steel pulley-and shaft design with some of the boundary conditions given and an unclear method on how to obtain convergence results from the analysis. The situation I will be modeling for this design is a motor applying a 100 N force to the flat outer surface of the shaft while one of the inner rectangular surfaces of the cutouts in the pulley wheel is restrained. This makes it so that while turning, the wheel will not be able to move along with the torque applied. Examples are shown below. Predictions were made from real life examples for FEA.

### Reverse Engineering of a Product and Documentation of its Solid Model

The product that I modeled is a hair dryer. I used a ruler and tape measure to measure the general horizontal and vertical dimensions of the body and handle. The tape measure will be used for regions that are hard to measure with straight edge rulers. Furthermore, galvanized wire used to approximate and mark the regions of changing curvature of the body and the handle of the hairdryer. These measurements, among others, are explained in detail in the report for the steps and guidelines for modeling the object.
