# The Zahn Innovation Center  
## Advanced Manufacturing Senior Apprentice 

### Background

I utilized prototyping tools to design and manufacture products for clients such as 3D printers, laser cutter, lathe, manual mill, drill, CNC machining, and various hand tools. I used concepts of Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T) and problem solving skills to aid a client in the use and modification of a parachute deployment mechanism to be used by runners to train. I am also leading a team to manufacture and assemble a real life replica of a R2D2 using various additive and subtractive manufacturing tools.

### CNC of A Bottle Cap Opener

The team was tasked with producing the G-code for a bottle opener produced in Solidworks for the HAAS CNC by utilizing HSMWorks, a CAM software A chamfer is also present in the top contour of the model. 
 
This project taught me the fundamentals and cautions of CNC and tooling operations such as material stock preparation and fixturing, reducing tool failure, and minimizing operation time.

Parachute Deployment Mechanism Project 
A client requested our team to produce an automatic mechanism that deploys and retracts a parachute for runners to train with a NDA restriction. I was tasked with making design alterations and drafts of the model on SolidWorks of the casings as well as adding mounts for electronics such as wiring for a motor and casings for batteries in the assembly.


### R2D2 Model
#### Manufacturing Lead 

I had led a team  to pursue a passion project to assemble a life size R2D2. We were collaborating with the electronics team so that the R2D2 was able to move and is able to communicate using Google Assistant technology. 

The dome/head of the droid as well as the battery boxes would be assembled using 3D printed parts while the rest of the body would be constructed using polystyrene. The polystyrene stock would be machined using various machines such as a CNC, bandsaw, manual mill, and hand tools as well.

Although the project had to be halted due to COVID-19, we had a lot of fun with it and gained exposure to manufacturing with plastics and 3D printed pieces.

### Mobile Whiteboard Education Suite

The mobile whiteboard project is a house project where the client provided four boards and a set of wheels and stands to accompany them.

**Problems:**
- Wheels were uneven and would misalign and make loud rattling sounds,
Boards and pipes within the framing of the assembly would make a rattling sound as well as they banged against the aluminum frame
- Add back shelving/side handles

**Solutions:**

Secure the wheels with set screws and locknuts in the wheel assembly
Zip-tie felt between the pipes and boards to reduce the rattling sound and further apply insulation between the materials

In order to implement the design intent of having the whiteboards be mobile, the client requested for us to add shelving to the back boards in order to hold markers, erasers, folders, and other general office supplies while on the move.
